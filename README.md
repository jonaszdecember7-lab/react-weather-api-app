My Weather App is a frontend portfolio project that demonstrates my ability to work with third-party APIs, handle errors, and build dynamic, responsive UI experiences.

The application integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, dynamically updates styling based on temperature conditions, and persists the user’s last search using localStorage for a better user experience.

This project was a fun challenge and helped me deepen my understanding of API integration, error handling, and condition-based styling — areas I hadn’t explored before.
